# Speech to Text Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of call center audio transcriptions through sentiment analysis. By converting speech to text and applying sentiment analysis algorithms, we aim to understand the nuances of customer interactions, sentiments, and overall satisfaction. Our analysis includes detailed visualizations that reveal patterns and insights into customer sentiment throughout the conversations.

## Key Features
**Sentiment Score Distribution**: Analysis of the distribution of sentiment scores to identify the prevalence of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments in call center interactions.

**Sentiment Magnitude Across Sentences**: A scatter plot visualization that displays the strength of sentiment for each sentence, providing insights into how sentiments vary throughout the conversation.

**Average Sentiment Score and Magnitude**: Through line plots, we examine the evolution of sentiment scores and magnitudes across sentences, helping to understand the dynamic nature of customer interactions.
## Contents
The project consists of a Jupyter notebook with the following structure:

22 Total Cells: Carefully segmented into code and markdown for clear, logical progression of analysis.

20 Code Cells: Featuring Python code that performs sentiment analysis, data visualization, and various data processing tasks.

2 Markdown Cells: Providing detailed explanations of the visualizations and insights drawn from the analysis.
